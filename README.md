# Description
It is a great honor to share my work! Open source information about the paper "A deep learning framework for inverse design of non-unique photonic structures:  DBSCAN-based quantitative analysis approach" can be found here.  
Instructions:  
1 About the code: The open source code is the code that I implement the algorithm in the paper. The code is dynamic, and by modifying some of the information, the same.py file can generate multiple test results. It is important to note that not every test result has a specific code corresponding to it, so you need to understand the logic of the code and modify the code accordingly according to the desired results.  
2 About the simulation program: All simulation is done in FDTD Solutions. I have open sourced the simulation data and uploaded the simulation file, which includes the connection scripts and scanning Settings for each module, which can be modified as required.  
3 About the DBSCAN algorithm code: Similarly, the code of the DBSCAN algorithm is also dynamic and cannot be directly run to get results. You need to modify the input file as required to obtain the corresponding result file.  
4 The joint debugging part of Python, FDTD and MATLAB: Although it is not reflected in detail in the paper, if you need to carry out forward verification, you can refer to the code of this part.  
5 Other notes: 1) As the data used in this project is very large, it is inconvenient to upload it to this warehouse. All data can be obtained by emulator and DBSCAN algorithm, please contact corresponding author if you need training data.  
2）Due to the complexity and complexity of this work, in order to meet the testing requirements, the code has undergone several modifications and repeated tests during the work. As a result, the code is frequently commented and modified for debugging purposes, resulting in less readable and aesthetically pleasing code. Therefore, all open source code and data are for reference and reference only.  

Chinese description：  
1关于代码：开源的代码是我实现论文中算法的代码。这些代码是动态的，通过修改部分信息，同一个.py文件可以生成多个测试结果。需要注意的是，并非每个测试结果都有对应的专门代码，因此需要了解代码的逻辑，并根据所需结果相应地修改代码。  
2关于仿真程序：所有的仿真均在FDTD Solutions中完成。我已将仿真数据开源，并上传了仿真文件，其中包括各个模块的连接脚本和扫描设置，可根据需求进行修改。  
3关于DBSCAN算法代码：同样，DBSCAN算法的代码也是动态的，无法直接运行得到结果。需要根据需求修改输入文件，以获得相应的结果文件。   
4关于Python、FDTD 和 MATLAB 的联调部分：尽管论文中未详细体现，但若需进行前向验证，可参考该部分代码。  
5其他说明：1）由于本项目所使用的数据十分庞大，不便上传至此仓库。所有的数据都可以通过仿真程序和DBSCAN算法获得，如果需要获得训练数据请联系通信作者。  
2）由于本项工作复杂且繁琐，为满足测试需求，代码在工作期间经历多次修改和反复测试。因此，代码被频繁注释和修改，以达到调试目的，导致代码的可读性和美观性较低。因此，所有开源的代码和数据仅供参考和借鉴。
